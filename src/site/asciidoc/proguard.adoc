== Shrink, Obfuscate and Optmize your APK with Proguard

=== Introduction

When packaging an apk, all classes of all libraries used by the program 
will be included. Potentially this makes the apk very huge, 
even exceeding the capacity of dex. ProGuard can strip unused classes and 
methods, make it as small as possible. In addition it can be used to obfuscate the 
classes in your apk.

The android maven plugin has built in support for ProGuard with the 
link./proguard-mojo.thml[proguard goal]. It supports using the `proguard.cfg` 
file and you can activate it with 

----
<proguard>
  <skip>false</skip>
</proguard>
----

The ProGuard version used is determined by the plugin itself and set to the latest available version.
If desired, a plugin-specific dependency declaration can be used to override the preconfigured version.
